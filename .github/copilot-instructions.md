# Copilot Guidance

## Best Practices
- New features require unit tests.
- Changes to code should be evaluated for documentation and README updates.
- If changes can be made in small commits, please do so to make review easier.
- During plan phase of a new feature, consider overall commit strategy dividing work into logical steps that can be committed separately (e.g. "Add config option and basic handling", "Implement new API endpoint", "Add tests for new feature", "Update documentation").

## Commit Messages
Use: "type(scope): desc" (under 50 chars long for the first line).
Include bullet points describing the changes in the commit to support the short description.
