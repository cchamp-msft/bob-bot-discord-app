# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## How to contribute

1. **Open an issue first**
   - Describe the problem, proposed change, and any relevant logs or reproduction steps.
   - This helps align on scope before code is written.

2. **Optionally open a pull request (PR)**
   - PRs are welcome for review.
   - Keep changes focused and include tests when behavior changes.

3. **If you only open an issue**
   - Issues may be worked by an active CODEOWNERS member at their discretion.

## Development

- Install dependencies: `npm ci`
- Run tests: `npm test`
- Build: `npm run build`

## Code of conduct

Please be respectful and constructive in issues and PRs.
